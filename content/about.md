I am Andreas Auernhammer, an undergraduate at the technical university (TU) Darmstadt, Germany. I am 
interested in cryptography, infrastructure technology and basically everything that runs the internet. 
That is why I write software in Go, Rust, C and Assembly, use Linux and try to make things at least not worse. :wink:

I believe in the power of OSS and a free and open community - so I have spent / will spend some time with contributing to various open source projects like Go or BoringSSL. 
If I do not write code or try to get a coffee, I am probably just climbing or bouldering.

Any questions, suggestions or issues? Contact me:

 For those of you who are interested in the boring stuff:
  
  - I am 23 years old
  - I finished school / started studying in 2012
  - I finished B.Sc. Computer Science in 2016
  - Since Oct 1st 2016 I am studying IT-Security
  - I will spend the summer 2017 as intern at [Minio](https://minio.io) (okay, this is actually really cool :wink:)
