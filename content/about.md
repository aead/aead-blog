**Hi, I'm Andreas, [@_aead_](https://twitter.com/_aead_). I do [Go](https://golang.org), (not enough) [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and cryptography.**

- **Minio Inc.**
  I [joined](https://twitter.com/_aead_/status/867448183609229312) the [Minio](https://minio.io) team in summer 2017 as an intern
  and since October 2017 I'm a member of this awesome team. I work in particular on the encryption features, TLS and other security
  related topics.
- **TU-Darmstadt**
  Since October 2016 I'm studying IT-Security at the [TU-Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/it-sicherheit-msc.en.jsp) as
  a Ma.Sc. student. The main focus of my studies is on cryptography.
- **OTH Regensburg**
  I started studying Computer-Science at the [OTH-Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/faculties/computer-science-and-mathematics.html) in October 2012
  and graduated as B.Sc. in August 2016.

### What I did

 - The AWS S3 encryption [implementation](https://github.com/minio/sio) of the Minio S3 server.
 - The Go implementation of the password-based key-derivation-function [Argon2](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/argon2).
 - Improved the Go TLS stack together with [Vlad Krasnov](https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/vlad-krasnov/)
   and contributed to Google's TLS implementation [BoringSSL](https://github.com/google/boringssl).
 - The Go implementation of the cryptographic hash functions [BLAKE2b](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/blake2b)
   and [BLAKE2s](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/blake2s).
 - The Go implementation of the [Poly1305](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/poly1305) MAC used in TLS 1.2 and 1.3
