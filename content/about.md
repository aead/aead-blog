My name is Andreas Auernhammer and I am studying IT-Security as a MaS. student at the TU Darmstadt, Germany.
I am interested in crytopgraphy and infrastructure technology and I believe in the power of OSS as well as a
free and open community. Therefore I write software in Go and Rust, optimize stuff with assembly and run linux
on the desktop. 

I really love to contribute to open source projects with a great community like Go or Rust. Whenever I need a
break from coding I try to relax during climbing or bouldering.

Any questions, suggestions or issues? Contact me:

 For those of you who are interested in the boring stuff:
  
  - I am 24 years old
  - I finished school / started studying in 2012
  - I finished B.Sc. Computer Science in 2016
  - Since Oct 1st 2016 I am studying IT-Security
  - I spent the summer 2017 as intern at [Minio](https://minio.io) in Palo Alto. (okay, that's actually really cool :wink:)
